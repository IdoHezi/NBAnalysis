# NBA Analysis
NBA SQL Analytics Project
üìå Project Overview

This project is a SQL analytics portfolio project based on NBA player statistics (Season 2024/25).
It demonstrates the ability to perform data exploration, advanced queries, and analytics using SQL, including:
Window functions
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Subqueries
Aggregations & conditional logic

The analysis is done on a dataset of NBA games with player statistics (points, rebounds, assists, game score, etc.).

üìä Key Analyses & Queries
## 1. Team Points Analysis

Total games played, points scored, and average points per game.
Breakdown of points in wins vs. losses.
### Team Performance Summary
Sample Output:
| Team | Total Games | Total Points | Avg Game Points | Points at Wins | Points at Losses |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| CLE  | 52          | 6366         | 122.42          | 5231           | 1135             |
| MEM  | 51          | 6312         | 123.76          | 4493           | 1819             |

```sql
SELECT 
    tm AS Team,
    COUNT(DISTINCT MDate) AS Total_Games,
    SUM(pts) AS Total_Points,
    ROUND(SUM(pts)/COUNT(DISTINCT MDate), 2) AS Avg_game_points,
    SUM(CASE WHEN res = 'W' THEN pts END) AS Points_at_wins,

## 2. Cumulative Points for Players (Boston Celtics Example)

Window function tracking cumulative points by game date for each player.
# Cumulative Points per Player
### Example Output (Jayson Tatum)

| Player        | Pts | Match Date | Cumulative Points |

FROM player_stats
WHERE tm = "BOS";
```

## 3. Overperformance vs. Seasonal Average
   
Detects games where a player exceeded their seasonal average points by 20% or more.
# Player Performance Example

| Player          | Team | Opposing Team | Match Date  | Points | Avg Points per Game |

| Miles McBride   | NYK  | BOS           | 2024-10-22 | 22     | 9.15              |

Code: 
```sql
WITH players_avg_points AS
(select player, tm as Team ,ROUND(avg(pts),2) AS avg_points_per_game
from player_stats
GROUP BY player, tm
order by avg_points_per_game DESC)
SELECT ps.player, ps.tm AS Team, ps.opp AS Opposing_Team,
ps.mdate AS Match_Date, ps.pts AS Points, pap.avg_points_per_game
FROM player_stats ps JOIN players_avg_points pap 
ON ps.player = pap.player 
WHERE ps.pts > pap.avg_points_per_game*1.2;
```

## 4. Player Impact Analysis
Measures player contribution by comparing average points & game score in wins vs. losses.
# Player Impact Analysis

| Player          | Win Rate (%) | W/L Avg Points | Impact Type       |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Jayson Tatum    | 69.4        | 1.17           | Winner           |
| Anthony Davis   | 57.1        | 1.23           | Clutch Winner    |
| Derrick White   | 71.4        | 1.04           | Winner           |
| Jrue Holiday    | 70.5        | 1.44           | Clutch Winner    |
| Miles McBride   | 68.3        | 1.19           | Winner           |
| Rui Hachimura   | 59.5        | 1.31           | Clutch Winner    |

Code:
```sql
WITH player_impact AS
(SELECT Player,
           COUNT(*) as total_games,
           SUM(CASE WHEN res = 'W' THEN 1 END) AS wins,
           ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN res= 'W' THEN pts END),1) AS avg_points_at_win,
           ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN res= 'L' THEN pts END),1) AS avg_points_at_lose,
           ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN res= 'W' THEN gmsc END),1) AS avg_score_at_win,
           ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN res= 'L' THEN gmsc END),1) AS avg_score_at_lose
FROM player_stats
GROUP BY Player
HAVING total_games >= 10)

SELECT player, 
ROUND((wins/total_games)*100 ,1) AS win_rate,
ROUND((avg_points_at_win / avg_points_at_lose),2) AS 'W/L_avg_points',
CASE 
	WHEN (avg_points_at_win / avg_points_at_lose) > 1.2 THEN 'Clucth Winner'
    WHEN (avg_points_at_win / avg_points_at_lose) > 1 THEN 'Winner'
    WHEN (avg_points_at_win / avg_points_at_lose) >= 0.95 THEN 'Consistent'
    ELSE 'Struggles in Wins'
END AS impact_type
FROM player_impact
WHERE (avg_points_at_win / avg_points_at_lose) IS NOT NULL;
```

Classifies players into categories: Clutch Winner, Winner, Consistent, Struggles in Wins.


## 5. Consistency Analysis (Game Score-Based)
   
Evaluates volatility and consistency of performance.
Labels players as Very Consistent, Consistent, High Ceiling, or Inconsistent.

Code: 
```sql
 WITH consistency_analysis AS (
    SELECT Player,
           COUNT(*) as total_games,
           ROUND(AVG(GmSc),2) as avg_game_score,
           STDDEV(GmSc) as game_score_std,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN GmSc < 5 THEN 1 END) as bad_games,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN GmSc > 20 THEN 1 END) as great_games
    FROM player_stats
    GROUP BY Player
    HAVING total_games >= 15
)

SELECT player, total_games, avg_game_score,
       ROUND(game_score_std, 2) as volatility,
       bad_games, great_games,
       ROUND(bad_games * 100.0 / total_games, 1) as bad_game_percentage,
       ROUND(great_games * 100.0 / total_games, 1) as great_game_percentage,
       CASE 
           WHEN game_score_std < 5 AND bad_games <= 2 THEN 'Very Consistent'
           WHEN game_score_std < 7 AND bad_games <= 4 THEN 'Consistent'
           WHEN great_games >= 8 THEN 'High Ceiling'
           ELSE 'Inconsistent'
       END as player_type
FROM consistency_analysis
ORDER BY bad_game_percentage ASC, great_game_percentage DESC;
```

## 6. Performance Trend by Month (Deni Avdija Example)

Uses window functions (LAG) to compare performance month-over-month.
Calculates percentage changes in average points.
# Player Monthly Performance (Deni Avdija)

| Player       | Team | Month | Year | Avg Month Performance | Previous Month Performance | Month Change (%) |
|--------------|------|-------|------|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Deni Avdija  | POR  | 10    | 2024 | 10.00                | 0.00                      | -               |
| Deni Avdija  | POR  | 11    | 2024 | 11.87                | 10.00                     | 118.70          |
| Deni Avdija  | POR  | 12    | 2024 | 16.75                | 11.87                     | 141.11          |
| Deni Avdija  | POR  | 1     | 2025 | 18.31                | 16.75                     | 109.31          |
| Deni Avdija  | POR  | 2     | 2025 | 12.25                | 18.31                     | 66.90           |

Code:
```sql
WITH player_avg_performance_by_month AS
(SELECT distinct player, tm , month(mdate) AS mnth, year(mdate) AS yr,
ROUND(AVG(pts) OVER(PARTITION BY month(mdate)),2) AS avg_month_performance
from player_stats
WHERE player = 'Deni Avdija'
ORDER BY yr, mnth),

player_performance_by_month AS 
(SELECT *, 
LAG(avg_month_performance,1,0) OVER (ORDER BY yr,mnth) AS previous_month_performance
FROM  player_avg_performance_by_month)
SELECT player, tm AS Team, mnth AS 'Month', yr AS 'Year',
avg_month_performance, previous_month_performance,
ROUND(((avg_month_performance/previous_month_performance) * 100),2)  AS month_change_percent

```

üöÄ Key SQL Features Demonstrated

Window Functions: SUM() OVER, LAG(), AVG() OVER

CTEs (WITH clauses): Used for multi-step analysis

Conditional Aggregations: CASE WHEN inside SUM/COUNT

Statistical Functions: STDDEV for volatility analysis

Data Classification: Custom player categories based on performance metrics

üìà Insights Example

Some teams score significantly more in wins compared to losses.
Players can be evaluated not only by scoring, but also by consistency and impact in team wins.
Month-over-month analysis provides insights into player development trends.

üéØ Project Value
